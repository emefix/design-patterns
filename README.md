## Structural patterns 
### 1.1. Adapter pattern
__Adopting new functionality.__
> * Adapter pattern works as a bridge between two incompatible interfaces.
> * The adapter class is responsible to join functionalities of independent or incompatible interfaces.
> * So, the adapter class is designed to add new functionality to the old class.

## Creational patterns
### 2.1. Builder pattern
__Building an object with fragments.__
> * To build a complex object, first create the necessary simple objects.
> * The builder class decides what a given object should look like and builds the final object step by step.
> * Use when the class being built has more than 4-5 member fields.
